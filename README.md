# Hexa.NET.StbImage

Hexa.NET.StbImage is a minimal C# wrapper for the StbImage library, providing a thin, 1:1 binding to StbImage's C functions. This wrapper is designed for developers who need direct access to the StbImage library's functionality from C#, without added complexity or overhead.

## Features
